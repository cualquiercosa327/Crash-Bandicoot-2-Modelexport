# Crash-Bandicoot-2-Modelexport
This is an unofficial and experimental tool for exporting models of Crash Bandicoot 2 and possibly Crash Bandicoot 3 in the future. For now, the tool is very primitive, depends on CrashEdit and only works for models that consist out of 5 items.

Usage:

1. Download the ZIP
2. Extract it in a directory
3. Using CrashEdit, export one animationframe and the 5 items of the model that you want to export to the same directory. They must have the following names:
  - "frame"
  - "item0"
  - "item1"
  - "item2"
  - "item3"
  - "item4"

4. Run the executable (and view the data if you are interested)
5. Press Enter and give up the filename, press 'OK'
7. Enjoy your model!

Important future improvements include:
- More accurate vertexcoloring
- 6-item model support
